## Instructor command history

We have a tool developed that allows us to log our history of shell commands and immediately send them to a GitHub repository for students in the classroom to view and copy and paste.  You can find this history [here](https://github.com/UWDIRECT/history/blob/main/history.txt).

## Additional information

**Absence and COVID Policy**:
Please let us know via email or private canvas message if you plan to miss a class. Please leverage this option if you test positive for COVID or otherwise are sick! If you miss a class (and let us know ahead of time) we will provide supplementary material. You are responsible for missed material.

**Religious Accommodations**:
Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW’s policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at Religious Accommodations Policy (https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the Religious Accommodations Request form (https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religiousaccommodations-request/).

**Accommodations & Access**: 
If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course. If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924 or uwdrs@uw.edu or disability.uw.edu. DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between the student, instructor, and DRS. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law.

**Title IX**: 
UW, through numerous policies, prohibits sex- and gender-based violence and harassment, and 2022-05-03 we expect students, faculty, and staff to act professionally and respectfully in all work, learning, and research environments. For support, resources, and reporting options related to sex- and gender-based violence or harassment, visit UW Title IX’s webpage (https://www.washington.edu/titleix/), specifically the Know Your Rights & Resources guide (https://www.washington.edu/titleix/2022/10/21/title-ix-rights-and-resources-for-uw-students/). If you choose to disclose information to me about sex- or gender-based violence or harassment, I will connect you (or the person who experienced the conduct) with resources and individuals who can best provide support and options. You can also access those resources directly: 
* Confidential: Confidential advocates (https://www.washington.edu/sexualassault/support/advocacy/) will not share information with others unless given express permission by the person who has experienced the harm or when required by law. 
* Private and/or anonymous: SafeCampus (https://www.washington.edu/safecampus/) provides consultation and support and can connect you with additional resources if you want them. You can contact SafeCampus anonymously or share limited information when you call. 

Please note that some senior leaders and other specified employees have been identified as “Officials Required to Report.” (https://www.washington.edu/titleix/title-ix-officials-required-toreport/) If an Official Required to Report learns of possible sex- or gender-based violence or harassment, they are required to call SafeCampus and report all the details they have in order to ensure that the person who experienced harm is offere

**Privacy**:
It is possible that some aspects of the course will take place over zoom (e.g. office hours). While students are encouraged to turn on their cameras if they are able, there is no requirement or penalty for keeping your camera off. For any session that is recorded on Zoom, the recording will capture the presenter’s audio, video and computer screen. The recordings will only be accessible to students enrolled in the course to review materials. These recordings will not be shared with or accessible to the public. The University and Zoom have FERPA-compliant agreements in place to protect the security and privacy of UW Zoom accounts. Students who do not wish to be recorded should: 
* Choose a Zoom username that does not include any personal identifying information like their name or UW Net ID; and 
* Not share their computer audio or video during their Zoom sessions.

**The University of Washington acknowledges the Coast Salish peoples of this land, the land which touches the shared waters of all tribes and bands within the Suquamish, Tulalip, and Muckleshoot nations.**
